    * git cherry-pick \[Commit id 1\] \[Commit id 2\] â€¦

* To avoid creating commit while doing cherry pick

    * git cherry-pick  \[Commit id of feature branch\] -n
    -n for no committing, above command will stage the commit of feature branch

## drop commit

* To drop commit First reset HEAD to parent commit

    * git reset \[Parent commit id\]

    After executing this command HEAD will point to parent commit

* To reflect changes on remote branch / To delete commit on Remote repository

     -f means force fully.

* If we want that commit again then we can get that using commit id
	* git cherry-pick \[commit id\]
